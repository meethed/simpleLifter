Ok we've done it. The new simpleLifter is live before the end of the year...18 minutes to spare...
It's not finished yet.
<ul>
<li>Archive hasn't been moved over</li>
<li>New comp spreadsheet has been rewritten and is full of bugs (it's not useable for comps yet)</li>
<li>Lights and barloaded timer works</li>
<li>You can create and edit new competitions</li>
<li>Live scoresheet works</li>
</ul>
It'll be ready in a month I reckon...
