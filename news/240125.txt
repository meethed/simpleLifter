APL added
<p>Ok so the APL rules are an interesting combination: IPF age categories (almost), "traditional" weight classes, no more raw and classic raw - just raw and wraps (and single/multi). The time between flights are somewhat arbitrary also, not just 10 and 20 minutes.</p>
<p>But most importantly, I've had to update the age group rules to include full DOB because IPF only goes off year of birth. This requires an update to the privacy policy and addition effort by me to protect uniquely identifiable information. Whilst DOB is not a major driver for identity theft, the less information that simpleLifter retains the happier I will be, and that's one of the reasons why I was so happy that IPF changed their age group rules to only require the year of birth. Anyways, IPF competitions now only need Year Of Birth (no change), whilst other feds will be asked for the lifter's full DOB in YYYY-MM-DD format.</p>
