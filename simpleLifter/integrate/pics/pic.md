Ok the file didn't work for some reason

filename convention:

firstnamelastname.jpg 

no ifs buts or maybes. no punctuation no spaces, no jpeg or png

why? cause i'm a lazy coder

aspect ratio is variable, 9:16 works just fine - it'll scale to suit.

privacy and storage concerns are legit. i'll work on something
