# simpleLifter

Hi! Welcome to the simpleLifter gitub. I don't really know what I'm doing here but now it's all available for everyone to use.

--What is it--
simpleLifter is an HTML based powerlifting competition ecosystem. It includes:
* lights and timers
* web browser remote control for the referees
* competition spreadsheet
* platform displays
* livestream overlays

--Where did it come from--
It started as a free and improved version of Stian Walgermo's referees app. From there, we realised OBS integration and livestreams would be possible
so I tweaked the nextLifter spreadsheet to 'steal' data and upload it to the server. At this point it was all running on a Raspberry Pi Zero W!!
simpleLifter the spreadsheet started when I realised how alternative systems (nextLifter and openLifter) had pros and cons but to tweak them to get
what I need would be near impossible. So I made my own!! 

--Why am I doing this--
My original involvement with this was trying to automate and improve powerlifting livestream quality, by fixing nextLifter overlays. From there, I
wanted to make a free wireless lights and timers system which was easy to deploy and eliminated trip hazards at competitions. I have competed and helped
at IPF affiliated competitions where the platform loads were written on a whiteboard, and lifting order was shouted out. 

It was horrible.

Quality competition management software, light systems, and overlays should be available at every powerlifting competition no matter what the level.

And it should be free. Cause I'm sick of people trying to profit off the goodwill of the meet directors, referees, spotters, tech desk, lifters, parents 
and friends, or anybody else involved in what is still a grassroots and amateurish sport.

--To anybody reading this--
Enjoy. I mean, you'll hate me once you look at the code. But I hope it helps.
